## Python Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator built in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and squaring a number.

To use it, run the script and select an option from the menu. The program will keep running until you choose to exit.

No external libraries are required â€” only Python 3.x.
